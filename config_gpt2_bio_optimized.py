Optimized WiggleGPT Configuration for RTX 3070 (8GB)
====================================================

This config uses modern training optimizations to speed up training:

1. RMSNorm instead of LayerNorm (~7% faster)
2. Lion optimizer (faster convergence, lower memory than AdamW)
3. torch.compile with reduce-overhead mode
4. WSD learning rate schedule (warmup-stable-decay)
5. Gradient checkpointing (optional, for larger models)

Expected speedup: 20-30% faster training with similar or better convergence.

Core model architecture preserved:
- 4 layers, 6 heads, 384 embedding dim
- Bio-inspired neurons with oscillating activations
- Sparse event processing
