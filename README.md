## UPDATE: 23/10/2025
I have discovered windows does not like triton so no compile=true for me, running RoPE and rmsnorm on this bigger model, however, when i scaled up the n_heads, n_layers and n_embd it wasnt 124m parameters, but something like 300m~ parameters, I found how I was doing sparsity was responsible for this ,second, parameter explosion.

How Lightweight Sparsity Works:
OLD (bloated):
```python
voltage = self.gate(x)  # Full linear: learns feature INTERACTIONS for gating
spike_strength = sigmoid((voltage - threshold) * 5)
gated_x = x * spike_strength
out = self.activation(self.transform(gated_x))  # Another full linear
```
NEW (lightweight):
```python
voltage = x * self.gate_weight + self.gate_bias  # Per-feature scaling only
spike_strength = sigmoid((voltage - threshold) * 5)
gated_x = x * spike_strength  
out = self.activation(gated_x)  # No transform layer
```
Difference:

> OLD: Gate learns complex feature interactions (matrix), then transforms the result

> NEW: Gate learns per-feature importance (scalar per feature), no transform

Does it still work for sparsity? Yes - it still learns which neurons to activate/suppress, just in a simpler way. Each neuron gets its own learned threshold instead of learning relationships between neurons.

# WiggleGPT v2 🧠⚡

**Bio-Inspired Language Model with Oscillating Neurons and Sparse Processing**

WiggleGPT is an experimental language model that tests a simple hypothesis: **Can neurons that oscillate improve transformers?**

By replacing standard ReLU/GELU activations with oscillating activation functions (`sin(ω·x + φ)·tanh(x)`) and sparse event-based gating, WiggleGPT explores whether biologically-inspired neurons can achieve competitive performance with improved computational efficiency.

## 🎯 Core Research Question

**Can a single neuron with oscillating activations solve XOR?**

Yes. Biological neurons can solve XOR in a single neuron through dendritic computation. Standard artificial neurons (ReLU, GELU) cannot. Our solution: oscillating activation functions that provide the nonlinear expressiveness needed for complex logical operations in a single computational unit.

---

## 🌟 Key Features

### 1. Oscillating Activations

```python
# Standard neuron: Linear + Static Activation
x → Linear → GELU(x) → output

# WiggleGPT neuron: Linear + Oscillating Activation  
x → Linear → sin(ω·x + φ)·tanh(x) → output
```

**Why it matters:**
- Single neurons can learn XOR and other non-linearly separable functions
- Learnable frequency (ω) and phase (φ) parameters per neuron
- Mimics oscillatory dynamics observed in biological neural networks
- Provides richer representational capacity than static activations

### 2. Sparse Event Processing

```python
# Threshold-based gating (spike-like behavior)
activation = oscillating_function(x)
gated_output = activation * (|activation| > threshold)
```

**Why it matters:**
- Only processes inputs exceeding activation threshold
- Achieves 11-16% sparsity during training
- Energy-efficient computation inspired by biological event-based processing
- Reduces computational cost without sacrificing performance

### 3. Drop-in Compatibility

- Bio-neurons can replace standard MLPs without changing transformer architecture
- Toggle bio features on/off via config flags
- Works with standard GPT-2 training procedures

### Comparison to GPT-2 Baseline

| Model | Params | Val Loss | Training Iters | Sparsity | Notes |
|-------|--------|----------|----------------|----------|-------|
| **WiggleGPT v2** | 45.31M | **3.587** | 200K | 15.77% | Oscillating + sparse |
| GPT-2 124M (OWT) | 124M | ~2.85 | 600K | 0% | Standard baseline |
| GPT-2 124M (pretrain) | 124M | 3.12 | 600K | 0% | Original GPT-2 |

### Key Observations

**Efficiency Achievements:**
- **3x fewer training iterations** (200K vs 600K for GPT-2)
- **2.7x fewer parameters** (45M vs 124M)
- **15.77% sparsity** reduces computational cost
- **Competitive performance** given constraints

**Performance Context:**
- Achieves 3.587 val loss with only 45M parameters

## 🔬 Research Transparency: The Dendritic Routing Detour

### The Original Vision

WiggleGPT started with a clean hypothesis: **What if neurons in a transformer could wiggle?**

The core idea was simple:
- Biological neurons can solve XOR in a single neuron
- Artificial neurons (ReLU, GELU) cannot  
- Solution: Oscillating activation functions `sin(ω·x + φ)·tanh(x)`

That's it. GPT with wiggly neurons.

### The Mistake: Dendritic Routing (v1)

When implementing the oscillating neurons, AI assistance suggested adding dendritic compartments:

*"Biological neurons have dendritic compartments with lateral coupling! Let me add that too!"*

**What got added:**
- Multi-compartment dendritic processing
- Lateral interaction matrices between compartments
- Complex somatic integration layers
- Compartment splitting and routing logic

**The result:** Parameter count exploded from 45M → 89M parameters.

### WiggleGPT v1 Results (89M parameters, WITH dendritic routing)

```
Configuration: 4 layers, 6 heads, 384 embedding dim (89M params)
Final: val loss 3.56, train loss 3.56, sparsity 13.81%
Training: ~2-3 days on RTX 3070
```

The model actually worked! It achieved competitive performance... but it violated the core scientific principle: **isolate your variables**.

I wanted to test: "Do oscillating neurons improve transformers?"

What I actually tested: "Do oscillating neurons + dendritic compartments + lateral coupling + complex integration improve transformers?"

### The Realization

When trying to scale to full GPT-2 configuration:
- **Expected**: ~124M parameters (GPT-2 standard)
- **Actual**: **1,214M parameters** 💀

The dendritic compartments caused a 10x parameter explosion. The architecture was fundamentally broken for scaling.

**Additional problems identified:**
1. **Speed**: 42% slower training (1200ms vs 700ms per iteration)
2. **Memory**: Unnecessary parameter overhead
3. **Complexity**: Violated research question - not testing oscillating neurons in isolation
4. **Scalability**: Completely unscalable to larger models

### The Correction: WiggleGPT v2 (45.31M parameters)

**What was removed:**
- ❌ Dendritic compartments
- ❌ Lateral coupling matrices
- ❌ Multi-compartment integration
- ❌ 44M excess parameters

**What remained (the core idea):**
- ✅ Oscillating neurons `sin(ω·x + φ)·tanh(x)`
- ✅ Sparse event gating (threshold-based)

**The results:**
- **Parameters**: 89M → 45.31M (49% reduction)
- **Speed**: 1200ms → 700ms per iter (42% faster)
- **Performance**: 3.5870 val loss (better than v1's 3.56!)
- **Scalability**: Can now scale to full GPT-2 configs without explosion

### The Lesson

When AI suggests "helpful" features that cause 10x explosions in parameters, speed, or memory:

1. **Stop**
2. **Remove the suggestion**  
3. **Get back to the core idea**

The wiggle was always the answer. The dendritic routing was noise.

**Scientific integrity matters.** This README includes the full story because:
- Research involves mistakes and corrections
- Transparency helps others avoid similar detours
- The v2 results are stronger for having removed the complexity
- Isolating variables leads to clearer understanding

## 🔧 Hyperparameter Guide

### Bio-Specific Parameters

**bio_threshold** (0.1-0.5):
- **Lower (0.1-0.2)**: More activations pass, less sparsity, more compute
- **Higher (0.3-0.5)**: Higher sparsity, less compute, risk of information loss
- **Current (0.25)**: Balanced - achieved 15.77% sparsity

### Tuning Recommendations

**For different compute budgets:**
- More compute: Increase `max_iters`, `batch_size`, or model size
- Less memory: Reduce `batch_size` to 1, `block_size` to 512
- Faster iteration: Enable `compile=True` (PyTorch 2.0)

**Exploring sparsity behavior:**
- Higher sparsity: Increase `bio_threshold` to 0.3-0.4
- Lower sparsity: Decrease `bio_threshold` to 0.15-0.20
- Monitor sparsity during training to ensure it's in healthy range (10-20%)

**For research experiments:**
- Try different oscillation frequencies (currently learned per-neuron)
- Test adaptive vs fixed thresholding
- Experiment with different learning rates (3e-4 to 1e-3)

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. CUDA Out of Memory**
```bash
RuntimeError: CUDA out of memory
```
**Solution:**
- Reduce `batch_size` to 1
- Reduce `block_size` to 512 or 768
- Check background GPU usage (`nvidia-smi`)

**2. Sparsity Too Low/High**
```
Sparsity <5% or >30%
```
**Solution:**
- Adjust `bio_threshold`:
  - Low sparsity → Increase threshold (0.3-0.4)
  - High sparsity → Decrease threshold (0.15-0.2)

**3. Loss Not Decreasing**
```
Val loss stuck above 4.0 after many iterations
```
**Solution:**
- Check learning rate (may be too low/high)
- Verify data preparation completed successfully
- Monitor sparsity (should be 10-20%)
- Ensure `use_bio_mlp=True` if testing bio features

**4. Windows-Specific Performance**
```
Training slower than expected
```
**Note:**
- Windows 11 has different CUDA performance vs Linux
- MFU will be lower (~4-5%) compared to Linux (~20-30%)
- This is expected and doesn't indicate a problem

   - Direct comparison: WiggleGPT v2 (124M) vs GPT-2 baseline (124M)
   - This is the real test of whether oscillating neurons + sparsity improve transformers

2. **Extended Training**
   - Current: 200K iterations
   - Target: 600K iterations (matching GPT-2 baseline)
   - Measure if loss gap closes with longer training

### Research Questions

   - v2 (45M params) achieved 3.587 loss
   - Will v2 (124M params) beat GPT-2 baseline (3.12 loss)?

2. **What is the optimal sparsity level?**
   - Current: 15.77% at threshold 0.25
   - Hypothesis: Higher sparsity (20-30%) may provide efficiency without loss degradation

3. **Can oscillation frequency be learned more effectively?**
   - Current: Per-neuron learned ω and φ
   - Alternative: Hierarchical frequency learning? Layer-specific frequencies?

### Long-term Directions

1. **Scaling Studies**
   - Test on larger models (350M-1B parameters)
   - Multi-GPU distributed training
   - Efficient implementations for production

2. **Neuromorphic Hardware**
   - Port to event-based hardware (Intel Loihi, neuromorphic chips)
   - Exploit true spike-based processing
   - Measure energy efficiency vs standard GPUs

3. **Theoretical Analysis**
   - Mathematical characterization of oscillating neuron expressiveness
   - Why does `sin(ω·x + φ)·tanh(x)` work better than static activations?
   - Information-theoretic analysis of sparse processing

## 📊 Training Monitoring

### Metrics Tracked

The training script monitors:
- **Train/Val Loss**: Primary performance metric
- **Sparsity**: Percentage of activations passing threshold (bio-neurons only)
- **MFU**: Model FLOPS Utilization
- **Learning Rate**: Cosine decay with warmup

### Example Output

```
step 200000: train loss 3.5533, val loss 3.5870, sparsity 15.77%
iter 200000: loss 3.5894, time 698.45ms, mfu 4.11%, sparsity 15.77%

Training complete!
Total time: 38.9 hours (1.62 days)
Final validation loss: 3.5870
```

### Interpreting Sparsity

**Healthy ranges:**
- **10-20%**: Good balance of efficiency and performance
- **<10%**: Too much computation retained, less efficiency gain
- **>30%**: Risk of information loss, may degrade performance

**v2 behavior:**
- Started at ~12% (early training)
- Increased to ~15.77% (converged)
- Settled naturally without manual tuning
