## 🔧 Standard Transformer Components

While bio-inspired neurons are the focus, WiggleGPT maintains standard GPT-2 transformer components for compatibility:

### Core Components

**LayerNorm** - Normalization layer with optional bias
```python
class LayerNorm(nn.Module):
    # Normalizes activations across features
    # Applied before attention and MLP in each block
```

**CausalSelfAttention** - Multi-head attention mechanism
```python
class CausalSelfAttention(nn.Module):
    # Standard GPT-2 self-attention with:
    # - Multi-head attention (n_head heads)
    # - Causal masking (can't attend to future tokens)
    # - Flash Attention support (PyTorch 2.0+) for speed
    # - Attention dropout for regularization
```

**Standard MLP** (when `use_bio_mlp=False`)
```python
class MLP(nn.Module):
    # Two-layer feedforward network:
    # x → Linear(4x expansion) → GELU → Linear → Dropout
    # Standard GPT-2 architecture (4x hidden dimension)
```

**Block** - Transformer layer combining attention and MLP
```python
class Block(nn.Module):
    # Standard transformer block with residual connections:
    # x = x + Attention(LayerNorm(x))
    # x = x + MLP(LayerNorm(x))
    # Pre-normalization architecture (LayerNorm before, not after)
```

### Additional Features

- **Weight Tying**: Token embeddings and output projection share weights (reduces parameters)
- **Flash Attention**: Automatic use of optimized CUDA kernels when PyTorch 2.0+ is available
- **Residual Connections**: Skip connections around both attention and MLP blocks
- **Dropout**: Applied in attention, residual connections, and MLP for regularization
- **Special Weight Initialization**: Scaled initialization for residual projections per GPT-2 paper

### When Bio-Neurons Are Disabled

If you set `use_bio_mlp=False` in your config, WiggleGPT uses the standard `MLP` class and behaves identically to vanilla nanoGPT/GPT-2. This makes it easy to:
- Compare bio vs standard performance
- Validate implementation correctness
- Debug bio-specific issues

### Configuration

Key parameters in config files:

```python
# Bio-neuron settings
use_bio_mlp = True           # Enable bio-inspired neurons
bio_compartments = 2         # Number of dendritic compartments (2-8)
bio_threshold = 0.25         # Sparse event threshold (0.1-0.5)

# Model architecture
n_layer = 4                  # Number of transformer layers
n_head = 6                   # Number of attention heads
n_embd = 384                 # Embedding dimension
block_size = 1024            # Context window

# Training (tuned for 8GB VRAM)
batch_size = 2
gradient_accumulation_steps = 16  
learning_rate = 6e-4
max_iters = 200000
```

### Sampling/Generation

Generate text from trained model:

```bash
python sample_bio.py
```

Customize generation:

```python
# In sample_bio.py
start = "\n Hello WiggleGPT how are you? :)"
num_samples = 10
max_new_tokens = 500
temperature = 0.5
top_k = 200
repetition_penalty = 1.2  # Default: reduces repetition
```

**Generation Features:**

1. **Repetition Penalty** (default: 1.2x)
   - Penalizes tokens that have already been generated
   - Applied by dividing logits of previously used tokens
   - Reduces repetitive text and improves sample diversity
   
2. **Top-k Filtering** (default: 200)
   - Retains only the top k most likely tokens
   - Sets all other token probabilities to zero
   - Prevents sampling from very low probability tokens

3. **Temperature Scaling** (default: 0.5)
   - Lower values (0.1-0.5): More focused, deterministic
   - Higher values (0.8-1.5): More creative, diverse
   - Applied before softmax to control randomness

4. **Context Window Management**
   - Automatically crops context to `block_size` (1024 tokens)
   - Maintains most recent tokens for generation

**Example Generation Loop:**
```python
for token in range(max_new_tokens):
    # Get logits from model
    logits = model(context)
    
    # Apply temperature
    logits = logits / temperature
    
    # Apply repetition penalty to used tokens
    for token_id in previously_generated:
        logits[token_id] /= repetition_penalty
    
    # Apply top-k filtering
    # Sample from distribution
    # Append to sequence
```

### Configuration System

`configurator.py` provides a simple command-line interface for overriding training parameters:

```bash
# Use config file
python train_bio.py config_gpt2_bio_3070.py

# Override specific parameters
python train_bio.py config_gpt2_bio_3070.py --batch_size=4 --learning_rate=3e-4

# Combine config file + overrides
python train_bio.py config_gpt2_bio_3070.py --max_iters=100000
```

**How it works:**
- Reads config files and executes them as Python code
- Parses `--key=value` command-line arguments
- Overrides global variables with proper type checking
- Allows flexible experimentation without editing config files

## 🧬 Bio-Inspired Components Deep Dive

### 1. Oscillating Activation Function

**Mathematical Form:**
```
f(x) = sin(ω·x + φ)·tanh(x) + baseline
```

**Key Properties:**
- Learnable frequency (ω) and phase (φ) parameters
- Enables XOR-like computation in single neurons
- Biological inspiration: Neurons exhibit oscillatory dynamics (gamma, theta rhythms)

**Implementation:**
```python
class OscillatingActivation(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_features, learnable=True):
        self.omega = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(num_features) * 0.1 + 1.0)
        self.phi = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(num_features) * 0.1)
        self.baseline = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(num_features))
    
    def forward(self, x):
        osc = torch.sin(self.omega * x + self.phi)
        return osc * torch.tanh(x) + self.baseline
```

### 2. Dendritic Compartment Processing

**Architecture:**
1. **Input Splitting**: Divide input into K compartments
2. **Local Processing**: Each compartment applies nonlinear transformation (Linear → Tanh)
3. **Lateral Coupling**: Compartments interact via learned coupling matrix
4. **Somatic Integration**: Integrate all compartment outputs with oscillating activation

**Detailed Implementation:**

**Step 1: Compartment Splitting**
```python
# Input (batch, features) split into compartments
compartment_inputs = x.view(batch, num_compartments, compartment_size)
# Each compartment gets a slice of the input features
```

**Step 2: Local Nonlinear Processing**
```python
# Each compartment has independent weights + tanh
for i, compartment in enumerate(compartments):
    compartment_out[i] = tanh(Linear(compartment_input[i]))
```

**Step 3: Lateral Coupling Matrix**

**Initialization:**
```python
# Learned matrix modeling inter-compartment influences
lateral = torch.eye(num_compartments) * 0.5 +  # Self-influence
          torch.randn(num_compartments, num_compartments) * 0.1  # Cross-influence
```

**Operation:**
```python
# Einstein summation: lateral coupling between compartments
lateral_influence = einsum('bkd,kl->bld', compartment_outs, lateral)
# b = batch dimension
# k = source compartment (what influences)
# l = target compartment (what is influenced)  
# d = feature dimension

# lateral[i,j] represents: influence of compartment j on compartment i
# This models lateral dendritic interactions in real neurons
```

**What lateral coupling achieves:**
- Compartments can amplify or suppress each other's signals
- Enables computation beyond simple feedforward processing
- Models biological lateral dendritic interactions
- Learned during training to optimize task performance

**Step 4: Somatic Integration**
```python
# Concatenate direct outputs + lateral influences
integrated = concat([
    compartment_outs.flatten(),      # Direct compartment signals
    lateral_influence.flatten()       # Cross-compartment influences
])

# Soma integrates everything with oscillating activation
soma_output = OscillatingActivation(Linear(integrated))
```

**Biological Inspiration:**
- Real neurons have dendritic trees with distinct computational compartments
- Different dendrites can compute different nonlinear functions (AND, OR, threshold detection)
- Lateral interactions between dendrites via spines and gap junctions enhance computational power
- Soma integrates all dendritic signals to produce final action potential

**Key Features:**
- Handles variable input sizes with automatic padding
- Configurable compartment count (2-8 typical)
- Optional lateral coupling (can disable for simpler model)
- Works with 3D transformer tensors (batch, sequence, features)

**Configuration Impact:**
```python
bio_compartments = 2  # Simple: 2 branches, faster, fewer parameters
bio_compartments = 4  # Balanced: good expressiveness vs speed
bio_compartments = 8  # Complex: maximum expressiveness, slower
```

### 3. Sparse Event Layer

**Mechanism:**
```python
# Step 1: Gate determines which inputs are "active"
gate_signal = sigmoid(linear_gate(input))  # [0, 1] activation strength

# Step 2: Threshold creates binary mask
active_mask = (gate_signal > threshold)  # Boolean: True if exceeds threshold

# Step 3: Only process active inputs
output = active_mask * transform(input)  # Zero out sub-threshold activations
```

**Sparsity Calculation:**
```python
def get_sparsity(self):
    # During forward pass, track:
    # 1. Gate activation: gate_signal = sigmoid(W_gate @ x)
    # 2. Active count: sum(gate_signal > threshold)
    # 3. Total count: total number of activations
    # Sparsity = 1.0 - (active_count / total_count)
    
    # Example: If 13.81% are silent (below threshold)
    #          Then 86.19% are active
    #          Sparsity metric = 0.1381 (13.81%)
```

**Threshold Impact:**
```python
threshold = 0.1   # Low:  More activations pass (low sparsity, more compute)
threshold = 0.25  # Default: Balanced sparsity (~50-60% during training)  
threshold = 0.4   # High: Fewer activations pass (high sparsity, less compute)
```

**Benefits:**
- **Computational Efficiency**: Only ~13-60% of neurons need computation
- **Energy Efficiency**: Mimics biological "silence is free" principle
- **Hardware Potential**: Sparse operations can be accelerated on neuromorphic chips
- **Gradient Flow**: Still differentiable via straight-through estimator

**Biological Analogy:**
- **Action Potentials**: Neurons only "fire" when membrane potential exceeds threshold
- **Sparse Coding**: Brain uses sparse representations for efficiency
- **Event-Driven**: Biological computation is event-based, not continuous
- **Metabolic Cost**: Firing spikes costs energy; silence is metabolically cheap

**Training Behavior:**
- Sparsity starts high (~60-70%) early in training
- Decreases as model learns (~13-30%) at convergence
- Model learns which neurons should be active for which inputs
- Adaptive sparsity patterns emerge naturally

## 🔬 Research Context

### Motivation

Traditional artificial neurons use simple activations (ReLU, GELU) that differ fundamentally from biological neurons:

| Feature | Biological Neurons | Standard ANNs | WiggleGPT |
|---------|-------------------|---------------|-----------|
| Computation | Dendritic trees, compartmentalized | Single weighted sum | Multi-compartment |
| Activation | Spike timing, oscillations | Static function | Oscillating activation |
| Communication | Sparse spikes | Dense activations | Threshold-based events |
| XOR capability | Single neuron can solve XOR | Requires multiple layers | Single neuron capable |

### Scientific Questions

1. **Can biological complexity improve AI performance?**
   - Current answer: Competitive performance achieved with resource constraints
   - 89M params achieving similar loss to 124M baseline demonstrates viability
   - Further scaling needed to fully assess potential

2. **Does sparsity provide computational benefits?**
   - 13.81% sparsity achieved during training
   - Reduces forward pass computation by ~14%
   - Trade-off: Additional gating overhead vs reduced computation

3. **Are oscillating activations beneficial for sequence modeling?**
   - Successfully integrated without destabilizing training
   - Model produces coherent text with oscillatory dynamics
   - Further analysis needed on emergent temporal patterns

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Sparsity Tracking

**How Sparsity is Measured:**

The `get_avg_sparsity()` method tracks activation efficiency in bio-neurons:

```python
def get_avg_sparsity(self):
    """Calculate percentage of activations passing threshold"""
    # For each SparseEventLayer in the model:
    # 1. Compare gate activation magnitude to threshold
    # 2. Count percentage of activations that pass
    # 3. Average across all layers and blocks
    # Returns: Float between 0.0 (no sparsity) and 1.0 (100% sparse)
```

**What the numbers mean:**
- **13.81% sparsity**: 13.81% of neurons are "silent" (below threshold)
- **50-60% sparsity**: Typical during training with default threshold (0.25)
- **Higher sparsity** = More efficient computation, but risk of information loss
- **Lower sparsity** = More compute-intensive, but potentially more expressive

Sparsity is logged during training:
```
step 200000: train loss 3.5604, val loss 3.5615, sparsity 13.81%
```

### Model FLOPS Utilization (MFU)

**MFU Calculation:**

The `estimate_mfu()` method estimates hardware efficiency:

```python
def estimate_mfu(self, fwdbwd_per_iter, dt):
    # Based on PaLM paper Appendix B methodology
    # 1. Calculate theoretical FLOPs per forward/backward pass
    # 2. Measure actual FLOPs achieved per second
    # 3. Compare to A100 bfloat16 peak (312 TFLOPS)
    # Returns: Fraction of theoretical peak performance
```

**Understanding MFU:**
- **4-5% on RTX 3070 (Windows 11)**: Expected for consumer GPU + Windows
- **20-30% on A100 (Linux)**: Typical for data center GPUs
- Lower MFU doesn't mean training is wrong—it reflects:
  - Memory bandwidth bottlenecks
  - Mixed precision overhead (fp16 vs bfloat16)
  - OS and driver differences
  - Smaller batch sizes (less parallelism)

### Checkpoint System

**What's Saved in `ckpt.pt`:**

```python
checkpoint = {
    'model': model.state_dict(),        # All model weights
    'optimizer': optimizer.state_dict(), # Optimizer state (momentum, etc.)
    'model_args': model_args,           # Architecture configuration
    'iter_num': iter_num,               # Current training iteration
    'best_val_loss': best_val_loss,     # Best validation loss so far
    'config': config,                   # Full training configuration
}
```

**Resume training:**
```bash
python train_bio.py config_gpt2_bio_3070.py --init_from=resume
```

The checkpoint preserves everything needed to continue training exactly where you left off, including optimizer momentum and learning rate schedule position.

### Training Features

**Mixed Precision Training:**

Automatic gradient scaling for fp16/bfloat16:
```python
# GradScaler handles fp16 precision
scaler = torch.cuda.amp.GradScaler(enabled=(dtype == 'float16'))

# Training loop uses automatic mixed precision
with torch.amp.autocast(device_type='cuda', dtype=ptdtype):
    logits, loss = model(X, Y)

# Scale gradients to prevent underflow
scaler.scale(loss).backward()
scaler.step(optimizer)
scaler.update()
```

**Benefits:**
- 2x memory reduction (fp16 vs fp32)
- Faster computation on Tensor Cores
- Automatic loss scaling prevents gradient underflow

**Distributed Data Parallel (DDP):**

Multi-GPU training support:
```bash
# Single GPU
python train_bio.py config_gpt2_bio_3070.py

# Multi-GPU (example: 4 GPUs)
torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=4 train_bio.py config_gpt2_bio_3070.py
```

**DDP features:**
- Gradient synchronization across GPUs
- Automatic batch splitting
- Linear speedup with number of GPUs
- Uses NCCL backend for GPU communication

**Learning Rate Schedule:**

Cosine decay with warmup:
```python
def get_lr(iter):
    # 1. Linear warmup (0 → learning_rate)
    if iter < warmup_iters:
        return learning_rate * (iter + 1) / (warmup_iters + 1)
    
    # 2. Cosine decay (learning_rate → min_lr)
    if iter <= lr_decay_iters:
        decay_ratio = (iter - warmup_iters) / (lr_decay_iters - warmup_iters)
        coeff = 0.5 * (1.0 + cos(π * decay_ratio))
        return min_lr + coeff * (learning_rate - min_lr)
    
    # 3. Constant minimum
    return min_lr
```

**Gradient Accumulation:**

Simulates larger batch sizes on limited memory:
```python
batch_size = 2                    # Micro-batch size
gradient_accumulation_steps = 16  # Accumulate gradients
# Effective batch size = 2 * 16 * 1024 = 32,768 tokens
```

This allows training with batch sizes that wouldn't fit in memory.

### Memory Optimization (RTX 3070 8GB)

The configuration is carefully tuned for 8GB VRAM:

```python
batch_size = 2                    # Small micro-batch
gradient_accumulation_steps = 16  # Effective batch: 32 examples
block_size = 1024                 # Full context window
dtype = 'float16'                 # 3070 lacks bfloat16

# Effective tokens per iteration: 2 * 16 * 1024 = 32,768 tokens
```

### Data Preparation (Streaming Mode)

`prepare_openwebtext_streaming.py` implements **memory-safe** data processing:

**Design Principles:**
- ✅ Streaming mode: Never load full dataset into RAM
- ✅ Chunk processing: Process 1,000 documents at a time
- ✅ Immediate write: Write tokens to disk and discard
- ✅ Constant memory: ~500MB peak usage (not 16GB+)
- ✅ Progress tracking: Real-time ETA and speed monitoring

**Inspired by**: Personal tiktoken-based conversations.json processing app for usage analytics

**Output:**
```
data/openwebtext/
├── train.bin  (~17 GB, ~9B tokens)
└── val.bin    (~8 MB, ~4M tokens)
```

**Processing Speed:**
- ~10,000-50,000 tokens/second (CPU-dependent)
- Total time: ~1-3 hours on modern CPU
- Validation split: 0.05% of data

### Training Monitoring

The training script tracks:
- **Loss**: Train and validation loss
- **Sparsity**: Percentage of activations passing threshold (bio-neurons only)
- **MFU**: Model FLOPS Utilization
- **Learning rate**: Cosine decay with warmup

## 🎯 Hyperparameter Tuning Guide

### Bio-Specific Parameters

**bio_compartments** (2-8):
- **Lower (2-4)**: Simpler model, faster training, less expressive
- **Higher (6-8)**: More complex dendritic computation, slower, more parameters
- *Current: 2* - Good starting point for 8GB VRAM

**bio_threshold** (0.1-0.5):
- **Lower (0.1-0.2)**: More activations pass, less sparsity, more compute
- **Higher (0.3-0.5)**: Higher sparsity, less compute, risk of information loss
- *Current: 0.25* - Balanced trade-off

### Tuning Recommendations

**For different compute budgets:**
- More compute available: Increase `max_iters`, `batch_size`, or scale up model
- Less memory: Reduce `batch_size` to 1, `block_size` to 512
- Faster iteration: Enable `compile=True` (PyTorch 2.0), increase `batch_size`

**Exploring bio-neuron behavior:**
- Higher sparsity: Increase `bio_threshold` to 0.3-0.4
- Lower sparsity: Decrease `bio_threshold` to 0.15-0.20
- More complex dendrites: Increase `bio_compartments` to 4-8
- Simpler architecture: Reduce `bio_compartments` to 2

**For research experiments:**
- Try different learning rates (3e-4 to 1e-3)
- Experiment with compartment connectivity patterns
- Test adaptive vs fixed thresholding

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. CUDA Out of Memory**
```bash
RuntimeError: CUDA out of memory
```
**Solution:**
- Reduce `batch_size` to 1
- Reduce `block_size` to 512 or 768
- Check background GPU usage (`nvidia-smi`)

**2. Sparsity Too Low/High**
```
Sparsity <5% or >50%
```
**Solution:**
- Adjust `bio_threshold`:
  - Low sparsity → Increase threshold (0.3-0.4)
  - High sparsity → Decrease threshold (0.15-0.2)

**3. Data Preparation Memory Error**
```
MemoryError during tokenization
```
**Solution:**
- Reduce `CHUNK_SIZE` in `prepare_openwebtext_streaming.py` to 500 or 250
- Close other applications
- Streaming mode is already enabled by default

**4. Windows-Specific Issues**
```
Training slower than expected
```
**Note:**
- Windows 11 has different CUDA performance characteristics than Linux
- MFU will be lower (~4-5%) compared to Linux (~20-30%)
- This is expected and doesn't indicate a problem
